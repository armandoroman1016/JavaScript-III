/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Principle one is the window/object binder. When we call on 'this' in the global scope we will get returned back to us everything Javascript gives us access to.

* 2. Implicit binding is when we use 'this' to call on our functions. This will refer to the Object that precedes the 'dot'.

* 3. The third principle 'New' is used when we want to create a new class using a constructor. We use the 'new' keyword to tie the new object to the constructor.

* 4. Explicit binding is some we used when we want to change or override a constructors values. We use Call and Apply to give 'this' object new values. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
